Hello all!

I have created a Health Disparities Project that highglights communities that are in need and suffering from various health implications and disparities.
Included is my SQL code that pulls data from various public health databases, a Python code to perform data analytics, and PowerBI to perform data visualization. 
I have also included visualizations from my Python code under .png files and under .csv files. 
Please see my word document for an in-depth explanation on my health iniative objective. 

Thank you!
